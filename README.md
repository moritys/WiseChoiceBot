### Technologies used:
- 🐍 python-telegram-bot
- 📚 SQLite
- 🎥 [API kinopoisk, unofficial](https://kinopoisk.dev/)

### What can:
- **Get two absolutely random films**: will return two random films from the entire movie search database, showing the poster, year, country, rating and description. If you are interested in one of the films, you can add it to your collection or watch it right away. If not, try again
- **Add a movie to the collection**: you can add it either from a random bot output or by simply sending a link to the movie (the link must be from kinopoisk.ru)
- **Delete a movie from the collection**: it can be deleted after it is issued by a bot or by entering a link to the movie
- **Select a random movie from your collection**: displays a random movie from those added by the user to his collection. If you decide to watch this film, you can immediately remove it from the collection using the button below the description

### What cannot:
- **Make coffee**
- **Explain Bogosort**
- **Watch a movie with you** <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExNTA3ZnlrMWR6dnk3M3F4N2lqbGdqODhqaGtzNG1icW9nNnN1ZXA2dCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/VfyC5j7sR4cso/giphy.gif">

### To improve:
- Add test coverage. Now the bot has been implemented using try-except and manually tested by several people
- Check the functionality of the API. Its creator is constantly making improvements and updates, so it is possible that some of the functionality has become unavailable
- 🐳
- Deploy the bot to a real server so that you can use it at any time without running it locally
